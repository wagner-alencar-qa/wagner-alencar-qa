# 🧪 Quality Assurance (QA) Study Portfolio

Hi there! 👋  
This repository is part of my **personal study portfolio focused on Quality Assurance (QA)**.  
Here I organize my learnings, practices, experiments, and materials related to **software quality, testing strategies, and continuous improvement**.

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems**, I am **27 years old**, and I am currently pursuing a **postgraduate degree in Software Quality and Testing Engineering**.

I have been continuously specializing in **Quality Assurance**, not only through my postgraduate studies, but also through **additional courses**, as well as by attending **live sessions, talks, and mentorship programs** with well-known professionals in the QA field — such as **Julio de Lima**, a QA specialist who works and lives in Florida.

I currently work as a **Junior QA / Software Tester**, with approximately **3 years of experience**, mainly focused on **manual testing**, applying best practices such as:

- BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
- TDD (Test Driven Development)
- Requirement analysis and validation
- Quality assurance focused on business value

I also have experience with **automated testing using Cypress**, although with less day-to-day exposure, and I am constantly improving my technical skills to expand my knowledge in **test automation, QA strategies, and software engineering best practices**.
